This is an archive of the programs to produce
tables 1-6 of Card's Ely Lecture, March 2009 AER

The "tablex.sas" programs read summary files created for
each year from underlying data. 

To actually run these programs you would have
to set up new directories, re-run the 1980, 1990, 2000
and 2005/2006 read programs, and then re-run
all the programs in each year-specific archive
