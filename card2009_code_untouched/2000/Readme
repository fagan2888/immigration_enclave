These are the 2000 programs (in order)

1. read2000.sas - reads the state-specific files
of the 192000 5% extracts, available from icpsr
The program also assigns PUMAs to msa's

The program combo.sas combines the state-level extracts
created by read200 and creates the all2000 file


2. np2.sas - takes the sas extract all2000
and creates a working data set of wage-earners
age 18+, with recodes, etc. This is np2000.sas7bdat
These data are used to build wage outcomes


3. allnp2.sas - takes the sas extract all2000
and creates a working data set of EVERYONE
age 18+, with recodes, etc. This is supp2000.sas7bdat
These data are used to build supply variables


Each of the following creates a set of tables by city
that are merged together in the final regression analysis
-------------------------------------------------------
 
4. cell1.sas - reads the data in np2000 and
creates a big summary of data by cell==>  bigcells.sas7bdat

5. t1.sas - reads the data in supp2000 and
creates a big summary of data by cell==>  allcells.sas7bdat

6. supply1.sas - reads the data in np2000 and
gets supply measures  ==> cellsupply.sas7bdat

7. imm3.sas  - reads the data in supp2000 and
gets counts of immigrants by sending country in
each city  ==> ic_citynew.sas7bdat

(IC is my classification of sending countries)

8. imm2.sas - reads the data in supp2000 and 
gets a count of immigrants present in 2000 
by IC  - this is used to construct the instrumental
variable  ==> byicnew.sas7bdat

9. inflow3.sas - uses results from imm1.sas (1980)	
   and imm2 (2000) to construct the supply push instrument
   by "education and experience cell" and city, 
   with and without mexicans
