These are the 2005/6 ACS programs (in order)

1. read2005.sas - reads in the sas data set version of
the 2005 ACS and renames the vars to match the 2000 Census

2. read2006.sas - reads in the sas data set version of
the 2006 ACS and renames the vars to match the 2000 Census

3. allnp2.sas - takes the sas extracts of the 2005 and 2006
ACS and creates a working data set of EVERYONE
age 18+, with recodes, etc. This is supp0506.sas7bdat
These data are used to build supply variables

This program reads the file msarecode_acs.sas
to re-code pumas to MSA's. This uses the
sas data set puma_to_pmsa.sas7bdat

4. t1.sas - reads the data in supp0506 and
creates a big summary of data by cell==>  allcells.sas7bdat
