These are the 1980 programs (in order)

1. read80.sas - reads the state-specific files
of the 1980 5% extracts, available from icpsr

2. np2.sas - takes the sas extract created by read80
and creates a working data set of wage-earners
age 18+, with recodes, etc. This is np80.sas7bdat
These data are used to build wage outcomes

*reads the code in smsarecode80.sas to re-code msa's

3. allnp2.sas - takes the sas extract created by read80
and creates a working data set of EVERYONE
age 18+, with recodes, etc. This is supp80.sas7bdat
These data are used to build supply variables

*reads the code in smsarecode80.sas to re-code msa's


Each of the following creates a set of tables by city
that are merged together in the final regression analysis
-------------------------------------------------------
 
4. cell1.sas - reads the data in np80 and
creates a big summary of data by cell==>  bigcells.sas7bdat

5. t1.sas - reads the data in supp80 and
creates a big summary of data by cell==>  allcells.sas7bdat

6. supply1.sas - reads the data in np80 and
gets supply measures  ==> cellsupply.sas7bdat

7. imm1.sas  - reads the data in supp80 and
gets counts of immigrants by sending country in
each city  ==> ic_city.sas7bdat

(IC is my classification of sending countries)

8. indist.sas - reads the data in np80 and 
  gets fraction of workers in MFG by city
